"""State kept for one long-lived pipeline connection.

Note (chenyang): These definitions could be hard to understand.

A stage is one segment of the pipeline that a unit passes through. Just as
we defined for Qwen3 Omni, thinker, talker, and the completion head are
stages. A stage receives a request, runs that request through its scheduler,
and routes the result to the next stage. When the session starts, the
coordinator picks one fixed worker for each stage and stores those owners on
the session. After that, every unit of the session runs only on those
workers.

A session is one long-lived connection. A session ID identifies it. State
stays across the many short requests/units of that connection, so a later
unit reuses what earlier units left behind: perception state, AR state such as
the KV cache and token history, and encoder or codec state. When a unit
finishes, that unit's own resources are released. The session state stays.
Closing the session releases that state and returns the session's capacity.

An operation is one action sent for a session: open, append, or close.
append is the unit above, and it follows the stages from one to the next.
open and close each target one stage. open visits the stages from upstream
to downstream and creates that stage's session state. close visits them from
downstream to upstream and releases the state. On one stage, open, append,
and close share one arrival order.

A cursor is one stage's record of the operations that have arrived for one
session. It keeps them in arrival order, and it keeps the place that may
start next. Each stage has its own cursor for that session. An operation
that enters the inbox takes the next place. The stage runs it only when
that place is due. Chunks emitted during append go back to the caller
through the coordinator.
